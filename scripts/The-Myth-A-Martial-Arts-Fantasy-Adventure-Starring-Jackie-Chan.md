Jack and William find the material in a meteorite that is suspended above a precipice by the zero gravity field. They are attacked by a group of mercenaries led by a man named Koo, who also wants the material. Jack and William escape from the tomb with the meteorite sample, but are pursued by Koo and his men until they are saved by Samantha, an Indian research student who claims to know Jack from a previous expedition.
 
Jack becomes intrigued by Samantha's tattoos, which bear a resemblance to the ancient markings on the mausoleum. Samantha tells him that her tattoos are related to the legend of the immortals, and that her people have been guarding the secret of the mausoleum for generations. She leads Jack and William to a hidden village where they meet an old monk who reveals that he was once a Dasar prince who visited China two thousand years ago. He confirms that Jack is the reincarnation of Meng Yi and that he can help him unlock his memories of his past life.
 
Meanwhile, Koo and his men track down the village and launch an attack. Jack, William, and Samantha manage to fend off the invaders and escape with the monk. The monk gives Jack a pendant that belonged to Ok-soo and tells him to go to China to find her. He also warns him that the elixir of immortality has a terrible side effect: anyone who drinks it will become immortal, but will also lose their memory and personality over time.
 
Jack decides to follow his destiny and travels to China with William and Samantha. They locate the entrance to the mausoleum with the help of Jack's pendant and a map tattooed on Samantha's back. Inside, they encounter many traps and puzzles that test Jack's knowledge of his past life. They also find Nangong Yan and Ok-soo, who have been living in the mausoleum for two millennia as immortal lovers, but have lost their memories of who they really are.
